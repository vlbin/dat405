First, how do we learn about the world? This involves both the\nproblem of modeling our initial uncertainty about the world, and that of drawing conclusions from evidence and our initial belief. Secondly, given what we\ncurrently know about the world, how should we decide what to do, taking into\naccount future events and observations that may change our conclusions?\nTypically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\neventualities. That is, when planning under uncertainty, we also need to take\ninto account what possible future knowledge could be generated when implementing our plans. Intuitively, executing plans which involve trying out new\nthings should give more information, but it is hard to tell whether this information will be beneficial. The choice between doing something which is already\nknown to produce good results and experiment with something new is known\nas the **exploration-exploitation dilemma**.\n\n## The exploration-exploitation trade-off\n\nConsider the problem of selecting a restaurant to go to during a vacation. Lets say the\nbest restaurant you have found so far was **Les Epinards**. The food there is\nusually to your taste and satisfactory. However, a well-known recommendations\nwebsite suggests that **King’s Arm** is really good! It is tempting to try it out. But\nthere is a risk involved. It may turn out to be much worse than **Les Epinards**,\nin which case you will regret going there. On the other hand, it could also be\nmuch better. What should you do?\nIt all depends on how much information you have about either restaurant,\nand how many more days you’ll stay in town. If this is your last day, then it’s\nprobably a better idea to go to **Les Epinards**, unless you are expecting **King’s\nArm** to be significantly better. However, if you are going to stay there longer,\ntrying out **King’s Arm** is a good bet. If you are lucky, you will be getting much\nbetter food for the remaining time, while otherwise you will have missed only\none good meal out of many, making the potential risk quite small.","metadata":{"id":"m_6obY12H7e7","cell_id":"00002-20f1360f-4ba0-4e50-9b7d-639ef06336a0","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Overview\n* To make things concrete, we will first focus on decision making under **no** uncertainity, i.e, given we have a world model, we can calculate the exact and optimal actions to take in it. We will first introduce **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** as the world model. Then we give one algorithm (out of many) to solve it.\n\n\n* Next, we will work through one type of reinforcement learning algorithm called Q-learning. Q-learning is an algorithm for making decisions under uncertainity, where uncertainity is over the possible world model (here MDP). It will find the optimal policy for the **unknown** MDP, assuming we do infinite exploration.","metadata":{"id":"fC-SVg0ZH7e7","cell_id":"00003-e28b97d7-5050-4a92-b39a-d3704b112642","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Markov Decision Process","metadata":{"id":"2zZ6HjxpH7e7","cell_id":"00004-eddda242-4cd5-46d8-b698-e41da258d917","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Markov Decision Process (MDP) provides a mathematical framework for modeling sequential decision making under uncertainty. A MDP consists of five parts: the specific decision times, the state space of the environment/system, the available actions for the decision maker, the rewards, and the transition probabilities between the states.\n\n* Decision epochs: $t={1,2,...,T}$, where $T\\leq \\infty$\n* State space: $S=\\{s_1,s_2,...,s_N\\}$ of the underlying environment\n* Action space $A=\\{a_1,a_2,...,a_K\\}$ available to the decision maker at each decision epoch\n* Reward functions $R_t = r(a_t,s_t,s_{t+1})$ for the current state and action, and the resulting next state\n* Transition probabilities $p(s'|s,a)$ that taking action $a$ in state $s$ will lead to state $s'$\n\nAt a given decision epoch $t$ and system state $s_t$, the decions maker, or *agent*, chooses an action $a_t$, the system jumps to a new state $s_{t+1}$ according to the transition probability $p(s_{t+1}|s_t,a_t)$, and the agent receives a reward $r_t(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1})$. This process is then repeated for a finite or infinite number of times.\n\nA *decision policy* is a function $\\pi: s \\rightarrow a$, that gives instructions on what action to choose in each state. A policy can either be *deterministic*, meaning that the action is given for each state, or *randomized* meaning that there is a probability distribution over the set of possible actions. Given a specific policy $\\pi$ we can then compute the the *expected total reward* when starting in a given state $s_1 \\in S$, which is also known as the *value* for that state, \n\n$$V^\\pi (s_1) = E\\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) {\\Large |} s_1\\right] = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} r(s_t,a_t,s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | a_t,s_t)$$ \n\nwhere $a_t = \\pi(s_t)$. To ensure convergence and to control how much credit to give to future rewards, it is common to introduce a *discount factor* $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$. For instance, if you think all future rewards should count equally, you would use $\\gamma = 1$, while if you only care less about future rewards you would use $\\gamma < 1$. The expected total *discounted* reward becomes\n\n$$V^\\pi( s_1) = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\gamma^{t-1} r(s_t,a_t, s_{t+1}) p(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) $$\n\nNow, to find the *optimal* policy we want to find the policy $\\pi^*$ that gives the highest total reward $V^{\\pi^*}(s)$ for all $s\\in S$. That is\n\n$$V^{\\pi^*}(s) \\geq V^\\pi(s), s\\in S$$\n\nThe problem of finding the optimal policy is a _dynamic programming problem_. It turns out that a solution to the optimal policy problem in this context is the *Bellman equation*. The Bellman equation is given by\n\n$$V(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} \\left\\{\\sum_{s'\\in S} p(s'|s,a)( r(s,a,s') +\\gamma V(s')) \\right\\}$$\n\nThus, it can be shown that if $\\pi$ is a policy such that $V^\\pi$ fulfills the Bellman equation, then $\\pi$ is an optimal policy.\n\nA real world example would be an inventory control system. Your states would be the amount of items you have in stock. Your actions would be the amount to order. The discrete time would be the days of the month. The reward would be the profit.  \n\nA major drawback of MDPs is called the \"Curse of Dimensionality\". MDPs unfortunately do not scale very well with increasing sets of states or actions.   \n","metadata":{"id":"KurOZxYjH7e7","cell_id":"00005-97d23759-51f4-4893-9600-06d5f864cdb5","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 1","metadata":{"id":"0iUmTgzwH7e7","cell_id":"00006-c96c3e02-f0a9-4b53-a478-2b250c17f53d","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this first question we work with the deterministic MDP, no code is necessary in this part.\n\nSetup:\n\n* The agent starts in state **S**\n* The actions possible are **N** (north), **S** (south), **E** (east), and **W** west. \n* Note, that you cannot move outside the grid, thus all actions are not available in every box.\n* When reaching **F**, the game ends (absorbing state).\n* The numbers in the boxes represent the rewards you receive when moving into that box. \n* Assume no discount in this model: $\\gamma = 1$\n\nThe reward of a state $r(s=(x, y))$ is given by the values on the grid:\n    \n| | | |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n|-1 |1|**F**|\n|0|-1|1|  \n|-1 |0|-1|  \n|**S**|-1|1|\n\nLet $(x,y)$ denote the position in the grid, such that $S=(0,0)$ and $F=(2,3)$.\n\n**1 Answer the following questions (1p)**\n\n**a)** What is the optimal path of the MDP above?

In each time step *t* the agent chooses an action *a* based on the current state *s*, observes the reward *r* and the next state *s'*, and repeats the process in the new state. Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small. This simple algorithm uses a table of Q-values for each $(s,a)$ pair, which is then updated in each time step using the update rule in step $k+1$\n\n$$Q_{k+1}(s,a) = Q_k(s,a) + \\alpha \\left( r(s,a) + \\gamma \\max \\{Q_k(s',a')\\} - Q_k(s,a) \\right) $$ \n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the discount factor as before, and $\\alpha$ is a pre-set learning rate. It can be shown that this algorithm converges to the optimal policy of the underlying MDP for certain values of $\\alpha$ as long as there is sufficient exploration. While a constant $\\alpha$ generally does not guarantee us to reach true convergence, we keep it constant at $\\alpha=0.1$ for this assignment.\n\n## OpenAI Gym\n\nWe shall use already available simulators for different environments (worlds) using the popular OpenAI Gym library. It just implements [different types of simulators](https://gym.openai.com/) including ATARI games. Although here we will only focus on simple ones, such as the [Chain enviroment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/NChain-v0/) illustrated below.\n![alt text](https://chalmersuniversity.box.com/shared/static/6tthbzhpofq9gzlowhr3w8if0xvyxb2b.jpg)\nThe figure corresponds to an MDP with 5 states $S = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and two possible actions $A=\\{a,b\\}$ in each state. The arrows indicate the resulting transitions for each state-action pair, and the numbers correspond to the rewards for each transition.\n\n## Question 3 (1.5p)\nYou are to first familiarize with the framework using its [documentation](http://gym.openai.com/docs/), and then implement the Q-learning algorithm for the Chain enviroment (called 'NChain-v0') using default parameters.
